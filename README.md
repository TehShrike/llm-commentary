# LLM Commentary

A non-chat way to get LLM to respond in the sidebar to whatever you're writing.

I tried to keep it from updating if you're in the middle of typing something, with middling success.

The default prompt is a generic "suggest things that could be added to this blog post" thing I threw together testing.

Right now it only uses Anthropic's API.  Get an API key [here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and if you want to try different models you can check out the list of options [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview).

Let me know if you get any good specific prompts and I'll add them here as examples.  I'm hoping to get one for giving ideas for RPG characters as I'm writing campaign notes, and another one for suggesting algorithm ideas as I'm writing technical design goals.
